# MATLAB on Amazon Web Services (Linux VM)

## Step 1. Launch the Template

Click the **Launch Stack** button to deploy a standalone MATLAB desktop client on AWS. This will open the CloudFormation Create Stack screen in your web browser.

**Note**: Creating a stack on AWS can take a few minutes.

## Step 2. Configure the Cloud Resources
After you click the Launch Stack button above, the “Create stack” page will open in your browser where you can configure the parameters. It is easier to complete the steps if you position these instructions and the AWS console window side by side.

1. Specify a stack name. This will be shown in the AWS CloudFormation console and must be unique within the AWS account.


2. Specify and check the defaults for these resource parameters:

| Parameter label | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **AWS EC2 Instance type** | The AWS instance type to use for MATLAB. See https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types for a list of instance types. |
| **Instance Name** | Give your MATLAB virtual machine a name |
| **Storage Size (GiB)** | Specify the size in GB of the root volume |
| **IAM Role (Optional)** | Specify an IAM Role to associate with this instance. |
| **VPC to deploy this stack to** | ID of an existing VPC in which to deploy this stack |
| **Subnet** | List of existing subnets IDs |
| **SSH Key Pair** | The name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to allow SSH access to all the instances. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html for details on creating these. |
| **Allow RDP connections from** | The IP address range that will be allowed to connect to this instance from outside of the VPC. This field should be formatted as \<ip_address>/\<mask>. E.g. 10.0.0.1/32. This is the public IP address which can be found by searching for 'what is my ip address' on the web. The mask determines the number of IP addresses to include. A mask of 32 is a single IP address. This calculator can be used to build a specific range: https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr. You may need to contact your IT administrator to determine which address is appropriate. |
| **Remote password** | Enter a password for the "ubuntu" user |
| **Confirm remote password** | Confirm Password |
| **License Manager for MATLAB connection string** | Optional License Manager for MATLAB string in the form \<port>@\<hostname>. If not specified, online licensing is used. If specified, the license manager must be accessible from the specified VPC and subnets |
| **Additional security group to place instances in** | The ID of an additional (optional) Security Group for the instances to be placed in. Often the License Manager for MATLAB's Security Group. |


>**Note**: If you chose to associate an IAM role above you'll need to acknowledge that it may create IAM resources in the Capabilities before creating the stack.

3. Click the **Create Stack** button.  The CloudFormation service will start creating the resources for the stack. <p>After clicking **Create** you will be taken to the *Stack Detail* page for your stack. Wait for the Status to reach **CREATE\_COMPLETE**. This may take up to 10 minutes.</p>

## Step 3. Connect to the Virtual Machine in the Cloud

1. Expand the **Outputs** section in the the *Stack Detail* page.
1. Look for the key named `RDPConnection` and copy the corresponding public DNS name listed under value. *For example*: ec2-11-222-33-44.compute-1.amazonaws.com
1. Launch any remote desktop client, paste the public DNS name in the appropriate field, and connect. On the Windows Remote Desktop Client you need to paste the public DNS name in the **Computer** field and click **Connect**.
1. In the login screen that's displayed, use the username `ubuntu` and the password you specified while setting up the stack in [Step 2](#step-2-configure-the-stack).

## Step 4. Launch MATLAB
Double-click the MATLAB icon on the virtual machine desktop to launch MATLAB. The first time you start MATLAB you will need to activate it. By default, you will be asked to use your MathWorks Account to activate MATLAB. For other ways to activate MATLAB, see [MATLAB Licensing in the Cloud](https://www.mathworks.com/help/licensingoncloud/matlab-on-the-cloud.html).

>**Note**: It may take a few minutes for activation to complete and MATLAB to start. You will experience this delay only the first time you start MATLAB.


# Additional Information

## Delete Your Cloud Resources

Once you have finished using your stack, it is recommended that you delete all resources to avoid incurring further cost. To delete the stack, do the following:
1. Log in to the AWS Console.
1. Go to the AWS CloudFormation page and select the stack you created.
1. Click the **Actions** button and click **Delete Stack** from the menu that appears.

### Resources

The following resources will be created as part of the CloudFormation Stack.

1. Security Group for SSH and RDP access
1. EC2 Instance
